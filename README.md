I don't think I'll be listing this on the store so if you want to download and use it:

1. Download the repository and place it a static location 
(you can't move the folder after adding it to Chrome)

2. Go to Chrome's extension page

3. Enable Developer mode

4. Click "Load Unpacked"

5. Browse to the location where you placed the repository

6. Open the folder with version number (1.1.0_0)

7. Enable the extension and you're good!
